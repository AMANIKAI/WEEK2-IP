    <h1>AMANI AGE CALCULATOR</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what
      day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to
      calculate the day of the week from a specific date
    </p>

    <h2>USER EXPECTATIONS</h2>
    <p>As a user on this page, you shall be able to</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        See a small description of what the application does on the landing page
      </li>
      <li>Enter your birthday through a form</li>
      <li>Choose what gender you are</li>
      <li>Click the submit button to see what your Akan name would be</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h3>EXPECTED RESULTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This application shall check whether the date and month entered is
        valid. if either of them is invalid, you shall be alerted and asked to
        enter a valid one
      </li>
      <li>
        This application shall output your Akan name depending on your gender.
        For example, if you are male and the result of the calculation is 0,
        then this application shall match that with Kwasi since Kwasi
        corresponds to Sunday which has an index 0. Hence the output you will
        see shall be something like “Your Akan name is Kwasi”
      </li>
